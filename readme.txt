Welcome to live_expl, the original repository for Pointwise-in-Time linear temporal logic (LTL) diagnostics on finite traces.

This is the work associated with https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13956 

We've migrated to a NEW repository with a cleaner implementation (and soon, actual documentation). 

In the meantime, please reach out to nbrindise@gmail.com for questions and support.
